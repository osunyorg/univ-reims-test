  Wheat and barley are the main cereal crops cultivated worldwide and serve as staple food for a third of the world’s population. However, due to enormous biotic stresses, the annual production has significantly reduced by 30–70%. Recently, the accelerated use of beneficial bacteria in the control of wheat and barley pathogens has gained prominence. In this review, we synthesized information about beneficial bacteria with demonstrated protection capacity against major barley and wheat pathogens including Fusarium graminearum, Zymoseptoria tritici and Pyrenophora teres. By summarizing the general insights into molecular factors involved in plant-pathogen interactions, we show to an extent, the means by which beneficial bacteria are implicated in plant defense against wheat and barley diseases. On wheat, many Bacillus strains predominantly reduced the disease incidence of F. graminearum and Z. tritici. In contrast, on barley, the efficacy of a few Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Paraburkholderia spp. has been established against P. teres. Although several modes of action were described for these strains, we have highlighted the role of Bacillus and Pseudomonas secondary metabolites in mediating direct antagonism and induced resistance against these pathogens. Furthermore, we advance a need to ascertain the mode of action of beneficial bacteria/molecules to enhance a solution-based crop protection strategy. Moreover, an apparent disjoint exists between numerous experiments that have demonstrated disease-suppressive effects and the translation of these successes to commercial products and applications. Clearly, the field of cereal disease protection leaves a lot to be explored and uncovered.
