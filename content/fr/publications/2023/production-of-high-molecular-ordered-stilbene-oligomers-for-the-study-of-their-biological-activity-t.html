abstract: >-
  Though the iconic stilbene resveratrol and its related dimers constitute a top storyline in the field of natural product research, resveratrol oligomers (condensation &gt;2) have been left aside despite their higher biological activity compared to that of the monomers. This situation largely results from the difficulty of getting them in sufficient quantities to enable evaluation of their biological properties in vivo. We present here a synthetic and critical analysis of the methods used for the production of high molecular-ordered stilbene oligomers of potential biomedical interest, gathering the most salient data regarding the approaches employed to prepare them by total synthesis, use of biomimetic approaches or through plant systems.
