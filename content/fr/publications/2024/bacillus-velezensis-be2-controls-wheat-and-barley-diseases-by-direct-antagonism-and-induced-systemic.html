abstract: >-
  Wheat and barley rank among the main crops cultivated on a global scale, providing the essential nutritional foundation for both humans and animals. Nevertheless, these crops are vulnerable to several fungal diseases, such as Septoria tritici blotch and net blotch, which significantly reduce yields by adversely affecting leaves and grain quality. To mitigate the effect of these diseases, chemical fungicides have proven to be genuinely effective; however, they impose a serious environmental burden. Currently, biocontrol agents have attracted attention as a sustainable alternative to fungicides, offering an eco-friendly option. The study aimed to assess the efficacy of Bacillus velezensis BE2 in reducing disease symptoms caused by Zymoseptoria tritici and Pyrenophora teres. This bacterium exhibited significant antagonistic effects in vitro by suppressing fungal development when pathogens and the beneficial strain were in direct confrontation. These findings were subsequently confirmed through microscopic analysis, which illustrated the strain's capacity to inhibit spore germination and mycelial growth in both pathogens. Additionally, the study analysed the cell-free supernatant of the bacterium using UPLC-MS (ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry). The results revealed that strain BE2 produces, among other metabolites, different families of cyclic lipopeptides that may be involved in biocontrol. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of strain BE2 in planta were assessed by quantifying the fungal DNA content directly at the leaf level after bacterization, using two different application methods (foliar and drenching). The results indicated that applying the beneficial bacterium at the root level significantly reduced pathogens pressure. Finally, gene expression analysis of different markers showed that BE2 application induced a priming effect within the first hours after infection.
