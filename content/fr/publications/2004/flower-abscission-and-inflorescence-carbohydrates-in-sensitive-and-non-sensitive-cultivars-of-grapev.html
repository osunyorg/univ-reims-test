  The Gewurztraminer (GW) and the Pinot noir (PN) cultivars of grapevine differ in their sensitivity to environmental factors that can cause flower abscission, cv. GW being the most sensitive. In order to further define the mechanisms leading to abscission, and owing to the importance of sugars in the achievement of sexual organ ontogenesis, we attempted to correlate the chronology of flower ontogenesis with the variations of carbohydrates in the inflorescence. In the vineyard, under optimal climatic conditions, fruit set of cv. GW and cv. PN was 82% and 65%, respectively. The sugar distribution was different in their inflorescences during the entire duration of flower development. Between stages 15 and 17, flowers of GW and PN reached the crucial meiosis stage. At that time, the inflorescences of cv. GW exhibited higher concentrations of starch and sucrose, whereas those of PN presented higher levels of glucose and fructose. Despite higher starch concentrations in GW inflorescences, starch reserves were present in the ovules and anthers of PN but not in those of GW. These results suggest that the higher content of reserve and transport carbohydrates in the inflorescences of GW favour flower development and fruit set under optimal environmental conditions. Furthermore, since meiosis represents a key step of female development, the different sugar concentrations in the inflorescences of the two cultivars at stages 15 and 17 could be related to the sensitivity to flower abscission under climatic stress. In particular, the presence of starch granules in PN ovules and anthers might explain the higher resistance of this cultivar to flower abscission.
