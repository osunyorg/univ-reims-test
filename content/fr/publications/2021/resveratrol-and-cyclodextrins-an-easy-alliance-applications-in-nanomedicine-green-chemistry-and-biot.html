  Most drugs or the natural substances reputed to display some biological activity are hydrophobic molecules that demonstrate low bioavailability regardless of their mode of absorption. Resveratrol and its derivatives belong to the chemical group of stilbenes; while stilbenes are known to possess very interesting properties, these are limited by their poor aqueous solubility as well as low bioavailability in animals and humans. Among the substances capable of forming nanomolecular inclusion complexes which can be used for drug delivery, cyclodextrins show spectacular physicochemical and biomedical implications in stilbene chemistry for their possible application in nanomedicine. By virtue of their properties, cyclodextrins have also demonstrated their possible use in green chemistry for the synthesis of stilbene glucosylated derivatives with potential applications in dermatology and cosmetics. Compared to chemical synthesis and genetically modified microorganisms, plant cell or tissue systems provide excellent models for obtaining stilbenes in few g/L quantities, making feasible the production of these compounds at a large scale. However, the biosynthesis of stilbenes is only possible in the presence of the so-called elicitor compounds, the most commonly used of which are cyclodextrins. We also report here on the induction of resveratrol production by cyclodextrins or combinatory elicitation with methyljasmonate in plant cell systems as well as the mechanisms by which they are able to trigger a stilbene response. The present article therefore discusses the role of cyclodextrins in stilbene chemistry both at the physicochemical level as well as the biomedical and biotechnological levels, emphasizing the notion of "easy alliance" between these compounds and stilbenes.
