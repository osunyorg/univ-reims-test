  Abstract Plant-associated Burkholderia spp. have been shown to offer a promising alternative method that may address concerns with ecological issue associated with pesticide overuse in agriculture. However to date, little work has studied the role of Burkholderia species as biocontrol agents for grapevine pathogens. To this end, two Burkholderia strains, BE17 and BE24 isolated from the maize rhizosphere in France, were investigated to determine their biocontrol potential and their ability to induce systemic resistance against grey mould disease in grapevine. Results showed the capacity of both strains to inhibit spore germination and mycelium growth of Botrytis cinerea . Experimental inoculation with BE17 and BE24 showed a significant protection of bacterized-plantlets against grey mould compared to the non-bacterized control. BE17 and BE24-bacterized plants accumulated more reactive oxygen species and an increased callose deposition was observed in leaves of bacterized plantlets compared to the control plantlets. In bacterized plants, gene expression analysis subsequent to B. cinerea challenge showed that strains BE17 and BE24 significantly increased the relative transcript level of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins PR5 and PR10 , two markers involved in the Salicylic acid (SA)-signaling pathway. Furthermore, in silico analysis of strains revealed the presence of genes involved in plant growth promotion and biocontrol highlighting the attractiveness of these strains for sustainable agricultural applications.
