abstract: >-
  Botryosphaeria dieback is one of the most significant grapevine trunk diseases that affects the sustainability of the vineyards and provokes economic losses. The causal agents, Botryosphaeriaceae species, live in and colonize the wood of the perennial organs causing wood necrosis. Diseased vines show foliar symptoms, chlorosis, or apoplexy, associated to a characteristic brown stripe under the bark. According to the susceptibility of the cultivars, specific proteins such as PR-proteins and other defense-related proteins are accumulated in the brown stripe compared with the healthy woody tissues. In this study, we enhanced the characterization of the brown stripe and the healthy wood by obtaining a metabolite profiling for the three cultivars Chardonnay, Gewurztraminer, and Mourvèdre to deeper understand the interaction between the Botryosphaeria dieback pathogens and grapevine. The study confirmed a specific pattern according to the cultivar and revealed significant differences between the brown stripe and the healthy wood, especially for phytochemical and lipid compounds. This is the first time that such chemical discrimination was made and that lipids were so remarkably highlighted in the interaction of Botryosphaeriaceae species and grapevine. Their role in the disease development is discussed.
