  Botryosphaeria dieback is one of the most widespread and prevalent grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) in Europe. Symptoms include necrosis of perennial organs of grapevine while external symptoms include bud necrosis, leaf discoloration and dead arms although incidence and severity vary from year to year. The causal agents of this disease are Botryosphaeriaceae species with Neofusicoccum parvum being one of the most prevalent. Their aggressiveness were reported to be influenced by environmental factors particularly temperature increasing disease severity. Thus, our study investigated the influence of heat and water stress on the grapevine / N. parvum interaction. Cuttings of Ugni Blanc, a cultivar known to be susceptible to GTDs, were artificially infected by N. parvum and subjected to two soil water status and two heat conditions (three days at 35°C or no heat stress). Plant growth, photosynthetic activity and the necrosis induced by N. parvum were monitored. The whole plant responses against these biotic and abiotic stresses, alone or in combination were investigated using transcriptomic and metabolomics analyses. Our results showed the two abiotic stress altered the photosynthetic activity of the vines. The response to infection differed depending on the abiotic stresses applied as revealed by specific transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles. The impact of heat and water stresses seems greater when they occurred simultaneously due to reduced plant growth and increased aggressiveness of N. parvum. The impact of infection on the metabolism was greater after a heat stress, compared to water stress, but highest severity was observed r when these two stresses were present. The lipids and secondary metabolites were the two plant compounds greatly impacted by the infection. Globally, these results may partly explain the seasonal variability of GTD symptom expression in the vineyards that may be influenced by abiotic stresses that can occur separately or simultaneously.
