  Low temperature is a critical environmental factor limiting plant productivity, especially in northern vineyards. To clarify the impact of this stress on grapevine flower, we used the Vitis array based on Roche-NimbleGen technology to investigate the gene expression of flowers submitted to a cold night. Our objectives were to identify modifications in the transcript levels after stress and during recovery. Consequently, our results confirmed some mechanisms known in grapes or other plants in response to cold stress, notably, (1) the pivotal role of calcium/calmodulin-mediated signaling; (2) the over-expression of sugar transporters and some genes involved in plant defense (especially in carbon metabolism), and (3) the down-regulation of genes encoding galactinol synthase (GOLS), pectate lyases, or polygalacturonases. We also identified some mechanisms not yet known to be involved in the response to cold stress, i.e., (1) the up-regulation of genes encoding G-type lectin S-receptor-like serine threonine-protein kinase, pathogen recognition receptor (PRR5), or heat-shock factors among others; (2) the down-regulation of Myeloblastosis (MYB)-related transcription factors and the Constans-like zinc finger family; and (3) the down-regulation of some genes encoding Pathogen-Related (PR)-proteins. Taken together, our results revealed interesting features and potentially valuable traits associated with stress responses in the grapevine flower. From a long-term perspective, our study provides useful starting points for future investigation.
